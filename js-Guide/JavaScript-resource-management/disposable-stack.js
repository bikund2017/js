/**
 * The DisposableStack and AsyncDisposableStack objects
 *
 * `using` and `await using` are special syntaxes. Syntaxes are convenient and hide a lot of the complexity,
 * but sometimes you need to do things manually.
 *
 * For one common example: what if you don't want to dispose the resource at the end of this scope,
 * but at some later scope? Consider this:
 */

/*
let reader;
if (someCondition) {

} else {
  reader = stream.getReader({ mode: "byob" });
}
*/

/**
 * As we said, `using` is like `const`: it must be initialized and can't be reassigned, so you may attempt this:
 */

/*
if (someCondition) {
  using reader = stream.getReader();
} else {
  using reader = stream.getReader({ mode: "byob" });
}
*/

/**
 * However, this means all logic has to be written inside the `if` or `else`, causing a lot of duplication.
 * What we want to do is to acquire and register the resource in one scope but dispose it in another.
 * We can use a `DisposableStack` for this purpose, which is an object which holds a collection of
 * disposable resources and which itself is disposable:
 */

/*

  using disposer = new DisposableStack();
  let reader;
  if (someCondition) {
    reader = disposer.use(stream.getReader());
  } else {
    reader = disposer.use(stream.getReader({ mode: "byob" }));

  // Before scope exit, disposer is disposed, which disposes reader

  // then it cannot be used with using.

    reader.releaseLock(),
  );
  // Do something with reader
  // Before scope exit, disposer is disposed, which disposes reader
}
*/

/**
 * You may have a disposal action to perform but it's not "tethered" to any resource in particular.
