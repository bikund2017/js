# My JavaScript Learning Journey

This repository serves as a collection of my work while learning JavaScript. It includes everything from basic syntax and data structures to more advanced topics like asynchronous operations, DOM manipulation, and object-oriented programming.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into several directories:

*   `js-Guide/`: Code snippets and examples from the official MDN JavaScript Guide.
*   `learn-js-web-dev/`: Exercises and examples related to web development with JavaScript.
*   `learning-path/`: A structured path of my learning, from basics to advanced concepts.
*   `projects/`: Simple applications built to practice and apply the concepts I've learned.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects you can find in the `projects` directory:

*   **Color Changer:** A simple web page where you can change the background color by clicking buttons.
*   **BMI Calculator:** A tool to calculate Body Mass Index.
*   **Digital Clock:** A real-time digital clock.
*   **Guess The Number:** A simple number guessing game.
*   **Keyboard Check:** An application that shows key codes for keyboard events.
*   **Unlimited Colors:** A project that changes the background color at a set interval.

This repository is primarily for my own learning and reference. Feel free to browse through the code to see my progress.
